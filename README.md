# Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter matches travelers to hotel stays based on the vibe of an inspiration
photo. Upload an image, and Ghostwriter analyzes its aesthetic to surface hotel
listings that fit the mood.

This is a hackathon project. Photo analysis runs on Google Gemini and hotel
listings come from the Stay22 Direct Travel API. No database or authentication
is implemented yet.

## Project structure

- `client/` — React app (Vite, JavaScript)
- `server/` — Express API server
  - `lib/gemini.js` — photo analysis + match captions
  - `lib/stay22.js` — hotel search and response normalization

## Setup

Requires Node.js 18+.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```

### 2. Add API keys

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `server/.env`:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes | Get one free at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Photo analysis fails without it. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | No | Defaults to `gemini-3.5-flash`. |
| `STAY22_API_KEY` | No | From [hub.stay22.com](https://hub.stay22.com). Without it the server uses Stay22's keyless demo mode, which works but is capped at **5 requests/minute**. |
| `STAY22_AID` | No | Stay22 affiliate ID for booking-commission attribution. |
| `PORT` | No | Defaults to `3001`. |

`.env` is gitignored — only `.env.example` is committed.

### 3. Run the backend

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The API server starts on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### 4. Run the frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The app opens on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 5. Try it out

Upload or drag in an inspiration photo and click "Find my stay." The app
analyzes the photo, shows the detected vibe and amenities as tags, then
searches for real stays and renders the matching hotel cards.

The destination picker under the tags lets you steer the search:

- **A specific place** — pre-filled with Gemini's guess and fully editable.
  Accepts a city, a region ("Amalfi Coast, Italy") or a country ("Portugal").
- **Anywhere** — Gemini picks three destinations matching the photo's vibe and
  the results are interleaved across all of them.

## API endpoints

### `POST /api/analyze-photo`

Accepts `multipart/form-data` with a `photo` field, or JSON
`{ "image": "<base64 or data URL>", "mimeType": "image/jpeg" }`. Max 10MB;
JPEG, PNG, WebP or HEIC.

Returns the Gemini analysis:

```json
{
  "vibe": "beach",
  "amenities": ["pool", "ocean view"],
  "destination_guess": "Santorini, Greece",
  "price_tier": "mid",
  "description": "Sun-bleached cliffside terraces above turquoise water."
}
```

`vibe` is one of `beach`, `urban`, `mountain`, `rustic`, `luxury`,
`minimalist`; `price_tier` is `budget`, `mid` or `luxury`. If Gemini returns
unparseable output, the server retries once with a stricter prompt before
returning an error.

### `POST /api/search-stays`

Accepts the analysis above plus:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `location` | Where to search — a city, region or country. Falls back to `destination_guess` when omitted. |
| `anywhere` | When `true`, `location` is ignored: Gemini picks three vibe-matched destinations and the server searches all of them, interleaving the results. |
| `checkin` / `checkout` | Optional `YYYY-MM-DD`. Defaults to a 3-night window 30 days out. |

Returns `{ destination, checkin, checkout, nights, stays }` — plus
`destinations` (the array of places searched) in `anywhere` mode. Each stay is:

```json
{
  "name": "Aeolos Art & Eco Suites",
  "location": "Imerovigli, Greece, 84700",
  "price": "$286/night",
  "imageUrl": "https://...",
  "bookingUrl": "https://www.stay22.com/allez/booking/...",
  "description": "Accommodation · 2 bedrooms · sleeps 4 · rated 8.8/10",
  "matchReason": "Cliffside suites echo the terraced whites in your photo."
}
```

## Implementation notes

- **Stay22 exposes no amenity data.** The `amenities` Gemini extracts can't be
  used as a search filter — there is no such parameter or response field. They
  steer the match captions instead, while `vibe` and `price_tier` map onto the
  filters Stay22 *does* support (`type`, `minstarrating`, `min`/`max`).
- **Prices require dates.** Stay22 only quotes a price when `checkin` and
  `checkout` are supplied, and quotes the *stay total*, not a nightly rate.
  Since the UI has no date picker yet, the server searches a 3-night window 30
  days out and divides the total by `meta.nights`. Pass `checkin`/`checkout`
  explicitly to override.
- **`gemini-2.5-flash` is retired.** It returns `404 — no longer available to
  new users`. The server pins `gemini-3.5-flash` instead; override with
  `GEMINI_MODEL`.
- **Gemini almost always guesses a destination** — it returned "Kyoto, Japan"
  for a featureless colour gradient. Because the guess is confident but often
  wrong, the destination picker is always visible and pre-filled with it rather
  than only appearing when the guess is `null`.
- **Broad regions geocode badly on Stay22.** "Southeast Asia" matched a village
  in Czechia and "Caribbean" returned a single result in Haiti. Cities,
  countries and named regions ("Amalfi Coast, Italy", "Tuscany") all resolve
  correctly, so the "Anywhere" prompt requires specific `Place, Country` names
  and rejects vague answers. Free-text entry is not restricted — a user who
  types a continent will get whatever Stay22 geocodes it to.
- **"Anywhere" tolerates partial failure.** The three destination searches run
  in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`; if one geocodes badly or rate-limits,
  the others still return. Only an all-failed result raises an error.
- **Match captions degrade gracefully.** They come from a second batched Gemini
  call; if it fails or is rate-limited, the server falls back to a rule-based
  caption built from star rating and guest score rather than failing the search.
